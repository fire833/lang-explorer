# Lang Explorer

Lang-explorer is a framework for writing programs using [formal grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar). It was originally authored as the software framework for the research conducted in my Master's thesis. As a result of this, it is likely a little rough around the edges. More work is being done to improve it's capabilities and to make it easier for others to use. Any suggestions or PRs are welcome.
